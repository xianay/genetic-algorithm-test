# genetic-algorithm-test

The code you provided seems to be a Java implementation of a genetic algorithm (GA) with examples for solving two optimization problems: question3 and question4. The GA is implemented using a binary encoding scheme, where individuals are represented as binary strings.

The GaApplication class contains the main method and serves as the entry point for the program. It initializes and runs the GA for two different optimization problems: question3 and question4.

The question3 method sets up the GA to solve an optimization problem where the objective function is to maximize 21.5 + x[0]*sin(4*pi*x[0]) + x[1]*sin(20*pi*x[1]). It specifies the fitness function, accuracy, dimension, lower and upper bounds, population size, maximum generations, crossover rate, and mutation rate. Then it calls the ga method with the necessary parameters, including a Visualization object for plotting the fitness values during the optimization process.

The question4 method sets up the GA for a different optimization problem where the objective function is to minimize -20*exp(-0.2*sqrt(sum(x.^2)/n)) - exp(sum(cos(2*pi*x))/n) + 20 + e. It follows a similar structure to question3.

The ga method is the main implementation of the genetic algorithm. It takes various parameters, including the fitness function, dimension, lower and upper bounds, population size, maximum generations, selection, crossover, and mutation functions, and a visualization object. It initializes the population, performs selection, crossover, and mutation operations in each generation, and updates the best individual and fitness values. It also provides a way to visualize the optimization process using the Visualization object.

The CrossoverFcn interface and its implementation CrossoverSinglePoint define the crossover operation for the GA. The crossover method in CrossoverSinglePoint performs single-point crossover between two parents based on a crossover rate.

The MutationFcn interface and its implementation MutationAdaptFeasible define the mutation operation for the GA. The mutate method in MutationAdaptFeasible performs gene inversion mutation with a given mutation rate.

Overall, this code represents a basic implementation of a genetic algorithm for solving optimization problems using binary encoding. The specific optimization problems and their objective functions are defined in the question3 and question4 methods. The ga method orchestrates the main steps of the GA, including selection, crossover, and mutation. The Visualization class provides a way to visualize the optimization process using JFreeChart.
